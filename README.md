# Digital impersonator

Digital impersonator is a project about using spaCy, Markov chains/markovify and a RESTful API in Flask to impersonate Donald Trump based on a corpus of data - Tweets or speeches. The front-end displays Donald Trump images with our generated text on them, clearly stating that it is a bot behind. 

Run the impersonator by executing `run-services.py`, or run the two services seperatly (being `run-client.py` and `run-server.py`).

**TODO:**

* Implement HTTPS
* think about config.py-file for settings (handy for future security-stuff as well)

**Who did what**

* Middleware: Mathias and Kent
* Front-end: Ã˜rjan
* NLP/NLG: Anca
* Back-end: Mathias and Kent

* In order to have better control over GitHub and presentable portfolio deliveries (data cleanup and analysis), Jupyter notebooks have not been commited to GitHub, but have been sent directly to the "integration" team.
