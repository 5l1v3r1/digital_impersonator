# Digital impersonator

Digital impersonator is a project about using nltk and a RESTful API in Flask to impersonate someone based on a corpus.

Run the impersonator by executing `run-services.py`, or run the two services seperatly (being `run-client.py` and `run-server.py`).

**TODO:**

* Implement HTTPS
* think about config.py-file for settings (handy for future security-stuff as well)
